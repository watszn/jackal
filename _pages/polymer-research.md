Over the Summer of 2015, I had the opportunity to conduct research with Professor Feng Zhang at UT Austin's College of Pharmacy.
Our research was based on a polymer called Polyacrylic acid (PAA). Using this polymer we studied its effects when mixed with other polymers and how these different complexations played a role in the drug release of matrix tablets. Over the duration of that summer, two research articles were published about our findings.


The abstracts and full research articles can be found below:
